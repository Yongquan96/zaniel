		        Hi Everyone, <br/><br/>

		   	    Zaniel was recommended by a friend of mine to set up my insurance plan for me and my family.<br/><br/>

				What I like about him is how clear he explains the packages, present what I could choose from, cater it to my needs and guiding me through the processes of setting things up.<br/>

				I had some challenges myself in setting up the payments, but Zaniel was very helpful getting it solved for me. I appreciated how fast he responded to my messages, even in the evenings. <br/><br/>
				Thanks again for the support!
